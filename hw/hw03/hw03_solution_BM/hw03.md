Consider the Voltera predator-prey system
x  1   x 1  x 1 x2
.
x 2  x2  x 1 x 2
Find the equilibrium points and their nature.

2. Equilibrium points and linearization
   System is
   x  1  x2 ( x 1  x2  1)
   x 2  x 1 ( x 1  x2  1)
   a.b.c.Find all equilibrium points
   Find Jacobian
   Find the nature of all e.p.s
   3.Simulate the system
   x  1  x2 ( x 1  x2  1)
   x 2  x 1 ( x 1  x2  1)
   using MATLAB for various initial conditions for the two cases:
   a.b.Take ICs spaced in a uniform mesh in the box x1=[-10,10], x2=[-10,10]. Make one phase
   plane plot with all the trajectories on it. Plot phase plane on square [-15,15]x[-15,15].
   Take ICs spaced in a uniform mesh in the box x1=[-3,3], x2=[-3,3]. Make one phase
   plane plot with all the trajectories on it. Plot phase plane on square [-5,5]x[-5,5].
