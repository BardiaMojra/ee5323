\title{Double Inverted Pendulum: \\
Stable Control via Feedback Linearization with
Python Simulation and Analysis}
\author{Bardia~Mojra}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Stable control of \emph{double inverted pendulum} (DIP) is a classic problem in
control systems and is considered to be a good case for studying and control
nonlinear systems.
DIP is highly nonlinear and sensitive to
the initial conditions which makes it particularly difficult to control.
This article focuses on the derivation of
\emph{equations of motion} and \emph{feedback linearization} method which,
were used to develop a symbolic representation of the system. We show that the
system characteristic matrix is positive definite and is invertible as required
by \emph{Lyapunov's direct method}. Using MATLAB
Control Toolbox, we solve the continuous \emph{Lyapunov control function} to
obtain the \emph{linear quadratic regulator} (LQR) solution which is considered
to be unique, stable, and optimal. To enhance this case study,
an end-to-end software suite is developed in Python to simulate, animate, and
analyze the system.
Moreover, a series of experiments are designed and performed to 1) study the
effects of variations in model
parameters (i.e. masses, pendulum lengths, and friction) on system stability,
2) investigate system dynamics and stability at different initial conditions,
given tuned and
untuned control parameters. 3) And to investigate and present some evidence
to confirm chaotic nature of the system.
The source code developed for this project will be available at \href{https://github.com/BardiaMojra/dip}{https://github.com/BardiaMojra/dip}.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this article is to present a concise, intuitive, and transferable
the solution to a classical optimal control problem.
Our objective is to model the plant using Lagrange's equations of motion,
derive state dynamics, obtain a generalized cost function, and to optimally
control the double pendulum by reaching a stable configuration in the upright
position while given minim-energy control input to the system.\\

\section{Estimation Formulation}
There are many benefits to using the \emph{state space} framework, notably that
is well generalized and conveniently implemented on modern computers.

\subsection{System Setup}
Consider a resting cart on a flat rigid surface along the x-axis, on top of
which are stacked two inverted pendulums, figure 01. The pendulums resemble a
robotic arm but rather without a motor or external torque input. At the end of
each pendulum is assumed to be a point-mass, \(m_1\), \(m_2\). Each pendulum
moves freely and independently and is connected by lengths \(l_1\) and \(l_2\)
from their joints, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) to their point-masses, \(m_1\),
\(m_2\). The mass of the cart is considered point-mass as well and is denoted
by \(m_c\) with its position \(q_c\) along the x-axis. \(\theta_1\) and
\(\theta_2\) denote angular deviations from upright position for \(q_1\) and
\(q_2\), respectively.

\subsection{State Definition}
Suppose we have a continuous-time, nonlinear system presented in state space
form.
% ss form

\begin{equation}
    % \label{eq:6}
    \dot{x} = f(x,u),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
% \label{eq:7}
    y = h(x).
\end{equation}

whats f - prediction model
whats h - obs model
omit obs noise, it requires EKF??

Our goal is to stabilize the described highly nonlinear system in the upright
configuration

\subsection{Global Coordinate Frame}
We need to form a homogenous configuration space to present state variables
\(q, \theta_1, \theta_2\) by forming a global coordinate frame with \(x(t=0)\)
as the origin.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    % \label{eq:6}
    q_c = \begin{bmatrix}
    q \\
    0 \\
    \end{bmatrix}, ~~
    q_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
    q + l_1 \sin \theta_1 \\
    l_1 \cos \theta_1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}, \\
    % \label{eq:6}
    q_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
    q + l_1 \sin \theta_1 + l_2 \sin \theta_2 \\
    l_1 \cos \theta_1 + l_2 \cos \theta_2 \\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\noindent
We denote position of point-masses for \(m_c\), \(m_1\), and
\(m_2\) by \(q_c, q_1, q_2 \in R^2\) on the x-y plane.
We seek to define our system in terms of these state variables. Thus, we define
state variable vector \(q(t)\) as
\begin{equation}
q = [q_c, q_1, q_2]^{T}
\end{equation}
In a later section, we formally rewrite state variable definitions independent of
time \(t\) via a linearization process. For simpler representation, we
denote state variable vector as \(q:=q(t)\).

\subsection{Other Considerations}
Noise and Friction modeling, process noise versus observation noise.

\section{Model Derivation}
% steps



\subsection{Equations of Motion}
As it is laid out in \emph{Lagrangian mechanics}; first we must obtain the Lagrangian
of the physical model, \(\mathcal{L}= K -P\). \(K\) and \(P\) represent the
\emph{kinetic} and \emph{potential} energies of the system. \(K\) is the total
kinetic energy from all three masses and in later sections, we will discuss
transforming \emph{Lagrangian mechanics} to \emph{Hamiltonian mechanics} by
replacing velocities with \emph{momenta}. Here, we define K as
\begin{equation}
    K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 =~ \frac{1}{2} {m_c\|\dot{q_c}\|^2 + m_1\|\dot{q_1}\|^2 + m_2\|\dot{q_2}\|^2}.
\end{equation}

P denotes the overall potential energy of the system; but since the cart rolls
flat along the x-axis, it is inherently incapable of storing energy so we discard
it. P is obtained by
\begin{equation}
    P = g \left[ m_1 l_1 \cos \theta_1 + m_2 (l_1 \cos \theta_1 + l_2 cos \theta_2) \right]
\end{equation}
Where \(g \in R\) denotes gravitational acceleration.
Next, we envoke the \emph{Euler-Lagrange} equation to write the following ODE system
whose solution is the position and velocity configuration vector of the cart
and masses on the x-y plane, given the final time, previous state, system
dynamics, control input and disturbances.
\begin{equation}
    y(t) = f(t,q,\dot{q},u,\omega)
\end{equation}
\emph{The Lagrange Equations of Motions} are defined as
\begin{equation}
    Q = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial f_{i}} - \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial f_{i}}\right).
\end{equation}
Where \(Q\) represents the vector of sum of external forces acting on the plan.
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(t, q, \dot{q})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\begin{array}{rcl}
    u + \omega_1 -d_1 \dot{q} &=& \frac{d}{dt} \{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{q}}\}-\{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial q}\}\\
    \omega_2 -d_2 \dot{\theta_1} &=& \frac{d}{dt} \{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\theta_1}}\}-\{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_1}\}\\
    \omega_3 -d_3 \dot{\theta_2} &=& \frac{d}{dt} \{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{\theta_2}}\}-\{\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_2}\}\\
    \end{array}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

So far our derivation has made our expressions more complicated but these steps are
necessary for capturing the full dynamical characteristics of the system. In the
following section, we derive the continuous-time nonlinear model of the described
system. Moreover in \emph{Optimal Control} section, we briefly explain how one
could derive \emph{the general optimal control solution} for a \emph{positive
definite and semidefinite energy system} with known characteristics.
Moreover, we intuitively explain and reference why we could consider the solution
space to such an ODE as \emph{smooth manifold} that maps current and future state
through recursion and its energy state decays towards a local minima.


\subsection{Continues-Time, Nonlinear Model}
We used MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox to derive the resultant ODE. Obtaining
symbolic or implicit expressions of our ODE will allow us to analytically derive
to the optimal solution.
\begin{equation}
\text{\scriptsize $
% \begin{cases}
\begin{array}{rcl}
    u + \omega_1 -d_1 \dot{q} &=& (m_c+m_1+m_2)\ddot{q}+l_1(m_1+m_2)\ddot{\theta_1} \cos \theta_1\\
    & & + m_2 l_2 \ddot{\theta_2} \cos \theta_2 - l_1 (m_1+m_2) \dot{\theta_1}^2 \sin \theta_1 \\
    & & - m_2 l_2 \dot{\theta_2}^2 \sin \theta_2\\
    \omega_2 -d_2 \dot{\theta_1} &=& l_1 (m_1+m_2) \ddot(q) \cos \theta_1
    +l_1^2 (m_1+m_2) \ddot{\theta_1}\\
    & & +l_1 l_2 m_2 \ddot{\theta_2} \cos (\theta_1 - \theta_2)+ l_1 l_2 m_2 \dot{\theta_2}^2 \sin(\theta_1 - \theta_2) \\
    & & - g(m_1+m_2) l_1 \sin \theta_1 \\
    \omega_3 -d_3 \dot{\theta_2} &=& l_2 m_2 \ddot{q} \cos \theta_2
    + l_1 l_2 m_2 \ddot{\theta_1} \cos (\theta_1 -\theta_2)
    + l_2^2 m_2 \ddot{\theta_2}\\
    & & -l_1 l_2 m_2 \dot{\theta_1}^2 \sin (\theta_1 - \theta_2)
    - l_2 m_2 g \sin \theta_2\\
    \end{array}
% \end{cases}
$}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Linearization}
First, we rewrite the equations of motion into matrix form to batch acceleration,
velocity, and position terms into separate matrices. A second order representation
of the physical system is sufficient to provide an accurate enough estimate,
per \emph{Taylor Series Linearization} method. This is an important step as
identifying system dynamics lies at the heart of \emph{Optimal Control}.
\begin{equation}
D(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q) = Hu
\end{equation}
where matrix functions \(D(q) \ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q}) \dot{q} + G(q)\)
represent systems dynamics with respect to time,
current state and previous state. Time variable \(t\) is omitted to simplify
notation. The system energy state (left hand side of
above EOM) is presented in relation to external forces \(Hu\) acting on the
system. Vector \(u \in R^1\) represents external input forces vector and matrix
\(H\) represents its relationship with state variable functions. Matrix
functions \(D(q),~C(q, \dot{q}),~G(q)\) and vector H are define as

\begin{equation}
% \text{\scriptsize $
% \begin{cases}
% \begin{array}{rcl}
    D(q) = \begin{pmatrix}

    \end{pmatrix}
% \end{array}
% \end{cases}
% $}
\end{equation}


We need to rewrite the EOM in the following
matrix form to obtain the final ODE. Per \emph{Lyapunov
Control Function theory} (LCF) for autonomous dynamical systems and
\emph{LaSalle's}, we can assume there exists a
\emph{Optimal Control Trajectory} or \emph{Hamiltonian Flow} for a valid
initial condition if the LCF is \emph{positive definite} or \emph{positive
semi-definite}.


Moreover, the energy function describing the system must be \emph{symmetric} and \emph{positive definite} in order to form \emph{stable} control trajectory.

\begin{equation}
M(q)\dot{q} = A(q)q + Bu
\end{equation}

Where \emph{positive definite} or \emph{positive semi-definite} constraints are
evaluated by computing the determinant of \(M\).
\begin{equation}
det(M) > 0;~ \forall q
\end{equation}
Such that, the final ODE can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \dot{q} = M(q)^{-1}(A(q)q + Bu)
\end{equation}
To make remove the time index and make the ODE fully \emph{isomorphic}, we
define a new variable state vector as
\begin{equation}
    x:=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        y \\
        \dot{y}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

L(x, u) =
 x T
 Qx + uT Ru


we
\subsection{Discrete, Linear Model}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
    x &=& Ax + Bu \\
    y &=& \dot{x} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

where A and B are defined as
\begin{equation}
    A =
\begin{bmatrix}
        0 & I \\
        D^{-1} \frac{\partial G}{\partial q} & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    B =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    D^{-1} H\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

\subsection{Linear Quadratic Regulator Solution}
So far, we have modeled, linearized, and discretized our system using state
space general form. In the process, we systematically reduced the solution space
complexity by replacing time \(t\) and velocity dimension as linear products of
current and previous states. This allows us to analytically derive a general
form optimal solution. But before we reach that step, we need to define a
general \emph{Cost Function} \(J\) that only depends on absolute minimal parameters,
which we will later optimize to arrive to a \emph{minimal surface}. Quadratic
performance index \(J \) is
defined as [see page 24 of Optimal control - now we can optimize similar to static cases]
\begin{equation}
J(x,u) = \frac{1}{2}x^{T}Q x + \frac{1}{2}u^{T}Ru
\end{equation}
whose solution is the minimal cost or minimum-energy input required for the
system to reach local minima, for any given initial state. Next, we minimize \(J\)
which will yield the state feedback weight vector \(K\) and is obtained by
recursively solving the dynamic \emph{Riccati} equation.
It is important to note that calculation of Quadratic losses are carried out by
performing dot product of state vector with its transpose and energy magnitude.


\section{Simulation and Animation}
For this project, both MATLAB and Python were used at different stages of the
development. Besides symbolic math derivation, MATLAB Control Toolbox was used
to check Python ODE simulation output and to obtain the LQR solution. MATLAB is
the gold-standard of scientific numerical analysis and Python is versaltile and
rich with high level feature. Various Python-based control system libraries were
explored and considered but were abandoned after observing variations in the
\emph{control vector} parameters. The LQR solution is expected to be optimal for
\emph{Lyapunov energy systems} and variations in the solution raises doubts
about numerical integrity of the computation process. For that reason, derivations
and control solutions used in this work are consistent with MATLAB.

Various Python libraries are used to simulate, animate and analyze model dynamics.
Pymunk and Pygame libraries are used create a 2D physics-based simulation
environment. Pyglet library (based on OpenGL) is used to create the animation,
figure \ref{fig_000_anim}. Source code for the animation and graphics are base
on examples and documentation provided by the authors \cite{pymunk}.
